><sup>Once the total number of each denomination of money is input the computer calculates the total pool of money and labor then displays an hourly rate and the cut for each employee based on the hours that were input. This page also has a form that you can use to input the date of the shift, and the money that you made in order to log your tip income each shift. </sup>

><sup>If you saved your shift you will be redirected to your account page and it will have a list of all the shifts you have logged in order of their input. (should it be by date instead?) you can delete or edit each shift using their action buttons at the end of the table. There is also a quick add function at the bottom of the screen if you worked a solo shift and just wanted to log the tip income without needing to divide amongst anyone else. At the bottom left there is an area to update your email if needed. This is validated with your password so it cannot be changed by mistake. And in the bottom middle of the page is a w.i.p that will allow you to choose 7 days, 1 month, or all time and the app will collect your shifts equal to one of those amounts and email them to the email on file in a text file if you would like to have your shift records somewhere else or if you need to print them out.</sup>
